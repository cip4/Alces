# CIP4 Alces
Alces is a CIP4 Tool for integration and testing of JDF Devices. On the one hand, if you are responsible for the integration in a printing house Alces enables you to test a JDF Interface of a JDF Device in order to find out how its works and if the device is configured on the right way.

Further, Alces is also a very useful tool for JDF Interface developers of JDF Devices. In this case the application plays the role of a Manager and helps to test the JDF compliance of your device. Alces is available in two flavors: one for interactive and manual testing and one for automated testing.
